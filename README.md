## Documenting Life


One interesting thing I understood about myself is that I have vast amounts of media stored 
virtually(using tech - computers, cameras, hard drives with music) over the years. 
This documents my environment in an excellent manner.

There is only one problem though. All the data is very fragmented. And I seek to build a tool
that helps in the defragmentation of data stored on prem and on cloud, especially 
in creative fields and fields with a lot of media in documentation.

### _Note: there are existing file systems and organizers that do this already,_ however, this project is intended to work on file management for data that was indexed with filenames with no fixed naming conventions and convoluted metadata. 

## Proof of Concept(In Python): `Documento v0.0`

This version is the proof of concept that I have worked upon. It has helped me in the defragmentation
(note: not the organization) of my music files from 

## Scope of `v0.0`'s Functionality:

## Anticipated Features in `Documento v(m,n)` hopefully not in Python:
_Note:_
```racket
;; v(m.n) refers to version m.n where m,n>0 
;; and outer box features :: m, inner box features :: n
```



- [ ] Remove redundant copies(including `copy` and `(n)` formats used in different systems
- [ ] Fix Convoluted and Inconsistent System of File Storage Structure(names) by:
  - [ ] Correcting file date(s) metadata(_seems wrong for some reason lol_)
  - [ ] Enforce a file naming convention(underscore, spaces, date, version by date, etc.)
  - [ ] Remove redundant words from names (E.g. in `lyric video`, `fhd 4k`)
