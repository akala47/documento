# Documento
## Documenting Life
#### _Disclaimer: This project is intended to be more of a sidequest and personal project, I do not intend to use this for commercial purposes._

Over the years, Iâ€™ve successfully stored vast amounts of media and files 
using devices like phones, memory cards, and hard drives, as well as virtually on the 
cloudâ€”creating
an excellent documentation on myself. 
However, this vast dataset has become fragmented, so I plan to develop a tool that 
defragments data in a structured manner.

This tool could be especially useful in creative fields and environments with large datasets of
media and documentation.

#### _Note: there are existing file systems and organizers that do this already,_ however, this project is intended to work on file management for existing databases with no fixed naming conventions and convoluted metadata. 

## Proof of Concept(In Python): `Documento v0.0`

This version is the proof of concept that I have worked upon. It has helped me in the defragmentation
(note: not the organization) of my music files from 

## Scope of `v0.0`'s Functionality:

## Anticipated Features in `Documento v(m,n)` hopefully not in Python:
_Note:_
```racket
;; v(m.n) refers to version m.n where m,n>0 
;; and outer box features :: m, inner box features :: n
```



- [ ] Remove redundant copies(including `copy` and `(n)` formats used in different systems
- [ ] Fix Convoluted and Inconsistent System of File Storage Structure(names) by:
  - [ ] Correcting file date(s) metadata(_seems wrong for some reason lol_)
  - [ ] Enforce a file naming convention(underscore, spaces, date, version by date, etc.)
  - [ ] Remove redundant words from names (E.g. in `lyric video`, `fhd 4k`)
